<p>
	I'm a software engineer by profession and scientist by nature.
	I graduated from McGill in 2018 with a B. S. Eng. & minor in philosophy.
	As an early career professional with 1 year of experience in full stack web development,
	my most recent experience is JavaScript development using the MERN stack. You can find more
	information on my experience in the projects section below or on <a href="{{site.base_url}}/assets/doc/Resume___Saahil_Hamayun.pdf">my resume</a>.
