<p>
	I'm a software engineer with two years of experience in full stack web development.
	A scientist by nature, I graduated from McGill in 2018 with a Bachelor of Software Engineering & a minor in Philosophy.
	I've been working as a software engineer at Yelp for past couple of years. Before that, in order of recency, I did some freelancing, spent some time at a startup, and did some volunteer research for one of my professors.
	You can find more information on my experience and professional skillset through the projects section below and through
