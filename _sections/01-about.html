<p>
	I graduated from McGill in December 2018 with a Bachelor of Software Engineering with a minor in philosophy.
	I'm enamored with user experience and tend to obsessively test my assumptions regarding it.
	Most recently, that has turned into a love of development using React.
	I find React to be a frontend library for backend developers (especially once Redux is introduced!).
	In between my computer science knowledge and my user-first attitude, I've found working with React to be a delight.
	It allows me the opportunity to focus on interface design and experience whilst also keeping
	me busy with logical challenges regarding information storage and control flow, allowing me
	the opportunity to truly flex my skillset and unite its components.
