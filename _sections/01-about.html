<p>
	I graduated from McGill in December 2018 with a Bachelor of Software Engineering with a minor in philosophy.
	I'm enamored with user experience and tend to obsessively test my assumptions regarding it.
	Most recently, that has turned into a love of development using React.

<p>
	I find React to be a frontend library for backend developers (especially once Redux is introduced!).
	In between my computer science knowledge and my user-first attitude, I've found working with React to be a delight.
	It gives me the chance to truly flex my breadth of skills by allowing me to unite the best of the two worlds of creativity and logic.
	I get the opportunity to focus on interface design and experience, but am also kept busy with logical challenges regarding information storage and control flow.
