		<p>
			I graduated from McGill in December 2018 with a Bachelor of Software Engineering with a minor in philosophy.
			I grew up with a strong passion for writing and I really enjoy the feeling that comes from clearly and simply expressing ideas.
			Channeling that feeling to the design and implementation of software systems, I've found a lot of beauty in reducing a system to its essence.
			These days I've been working with React and Node and find that componentization really lends itself to that beauty.
