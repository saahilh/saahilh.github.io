		<p>Since graduating from McGill in December 2018, I've been taking time to broaden my knowledge of the world. I completed a Bachelor of Software Engineering with a minor in philosophy, and wish I could go back and complete a few more degrees. One of my biggest regrets is not having been a better student growing up, and over the last couple of years I've been making an increasing commitment to resolve that. I find it interesting how stepping away from school is what let me reach this point.</p>

		<p>If you're ever downtown and close to King station, and happen to look at the right window, you may spot me engrossed in reading an article or jumping between the terminal and a browser. If you've read any good articles or papers, or had any ideas you would like to discuss, please don't hestitate to contact me. I'd love to discuss them.</p>

		<p>Things I'd currently love to learn more about include: React, Node, Vue, Angular, CI/CD, TDD, UX, graphic design, network protocols, compilers, machine learning, history, botany, astronomy, music, and really just about anything else. Of course, at present that's more a dream and wishlist than anything. If you happen to know how I can find the time to explore everything, I'll be willing to sell my soul for your secrets. If you have a project where I can use one or more of these things, and you'll forgive me figuring them out as I go, then don't be alarmed if I proposition you in the next few weeks.</p>
