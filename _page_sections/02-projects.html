I've worked on a variety of projects over the years. Here are some of them:
<ul>
	<li>Graduate Attribute Managements System (GAMS): Node.js application used to analyze program achievement through student grades</li>
	<li>Classroom Friend: a Ruby on Rails application for in-class student-lecturer communication</li>
	<li>OurCourses: Flask-based basic social network for students to communicate</li>
	<li>RestoApp: Spring Boot application to manage restaurant layout, orders, and reservations</li>
	<li>Merch Manager: Ruby on Rails application to managing products intended for Shopify app store</li>
	<li>Creating an object oriented representation of a LeJOS robot to more easily command it by refactoring implementations</li>
	<li>Linux-like file system implementation using C</li>
	<li>Domain specific language for car dealerships to manage inventory and using Acceleo</li>
</ul>
