            * Most proud of:
                * authxios (in the end decided to called it auth_fetch for usability lol)
                * using screenreader to test accessibility and really figure out what it meant for a website to be accessible
        * JSX Lite:
            * Most proud of creating a web-based coding environment for what was initially just a backend project.
                * Code is intangible and its hard to show people what's happening in the case of transformations.
                    I wanted to increase the reach of the code and allowing people to easily access and try the transformation
                    seemed perfect for that. It really fits the spirit of web development because it matches the essence of why 
                    web app development is so big right now: it allows applications to be easily accessed and used by everyone
                    without needing custom systems or big downloads.
