- name: Jsx Lite
  description:
    A babel-based tool that will serve as a lightweight transpiler from jsx to html.
    I wanted to try going from jsx to HTML in an effort to learn how to make DSLs using JavaScript.
    For now, this uses plugin-transform-react-jsx to handle conversions from jsx to method calls.
    So in the transformation of jsx -> js -> html, I am currently working on the js -> html step.

  description:
    An implementation of Tetris I created using React.js.
    I wanted to challenge myself so I went at it without
    looking at how people implemented the game, though I
    did use the React 'Todo List' tutorial to learn the 
    basics of React.
